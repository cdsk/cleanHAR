CleanHAR codebook
=================

This codebook is part of my submission for the course project for Getting and cleaning data on Coursera. My submission can be found on https://github.com/cdsk/cleanHAR

The content is heavily based on the information for the original public domain dataset on http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones in particular it takes large amounts of content from the files features.txt and features_info.txt from the original dataset and also includes information from the dataset description on http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.names

Dataset description
===================

This dataset is the result of processing and cleaning the original dataset. The dataset contains summarised averages of measurements of smartphone sensors for human activity recognition. The experiments to obtain the dataset have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Check the README.txt file from the original dataset for further details about this dataset.

A video of the experiment including an example of the 6 recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen in the following link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEN9W05_4A

There are 180 records (rows) in the dataset: One for each of the six activities for each of the 30 subjects.

For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- Subject: An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. An integer between 1 and 30.
- Activity: Its activity label. One out of: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 66-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2).
- The gyroscope units are rad/seg.
- Only variables from the original dataset were selected for which both a mean and a standard deviation were available.
- Variables for three features from the frequency domain of the original dataset were badly named in the original dataset and the naming has been fixed in our result: fBodyBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyBodyGyroMag, fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag have been renamed to fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, and fBodyGyroJerkMag respectively.

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' are used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

For these signals both mean and standard deviation (std) of all measurements per subject and activity were aggregated and an overall average calculated.
